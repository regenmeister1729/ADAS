VisionDrive: Vision-Based ADAS System
Project Overview
Real-time ADAS simulation using OpenCV and YOLOv8 on dashcam video
Combines classical image processing with deep learning
Provides lane detection, vehicle detection, safety warnings, and visual feedback
Core Functionalities
Lane boundary detection and lane area estimation
Vehicle detection with bounding boxes and confidence scores
Region of Interest (ROI) masking for focused analysis
Vehicle counting inside lane boundaries
Forward collision / crash warning system
Lane departure warning
Unified annotated ADAS output video
Processing Pipeline (Per Frame)
1️ Lane Detection
Grayscale conversion and Gaussian blur
Canny edge detection
ROI masking to isolate road region
Hough Line Transform to detect lane lines
Lane center and lane polygon estimation
Output: Yellow lane overlay and lane polygon

2️ Safety Zone & Collision Warning
Defined trapezoidal safety region ahead of vehicle
Motion detection inside region using background subtraction (MOG2)
Contour area thresholding to detect obstacles
Crash alert triggered when risk threshold exceeded
Output: Red safety zone, warning text, frame tint during alert

3️ Vehicle Detection, Tracking & Counting
YOLOv8 used for detecting cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles
Tracking enabled with unique IDs
Centroid calculation for each vehicle
Vehicles counted only when centroid lies inside lane polygon
Double counting avoided using counted_ids set
Output:

Bounding boxes with Track ID and confidence score
Green boxes (inside lane), Red boxes (outside lane)
Live vehicle count display
Key Design Features
ROI-based filtering to reduce false positives
Controlled alert frequency for safety-critical behavior
Combination of classical CV (edges, Hough) and YOLO detection
Real-time frame-by-frame processing and visualization
Final Output
Single annotated video stream showing:

Lane overlays
Vehicle detections
ROI mask
Vehicle count
Collision and lane departure warningsVisionDrive: Vision-Based ADAS System
